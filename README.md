# Url Shortener

This is a demo program I have written that mimics the function of tinyurl.com. It uses Django for the backend for data validation and in order to store url information in a database.

## Starting the server

To run this program, open your terminal and navigate to the file location. Then, type "python manage.py runserver". This will start the server. You can then navigate to "localhost:8000" in your browser to view the website. To close the server, return to your terminal and type ctrl+c. 

## Using the program

Program intructions are given to you as you use the application.

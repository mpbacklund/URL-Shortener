# Url Shortener

This is a demo program I have written that mimics the function of tinyurl.com. It uses Django for the backend for data validation and in order to store url information in a database.

## Starting the server

To run this program, open your terminal and navigate to the file location. Then type `python manage.py runserver`. This will start the server. You can then navigate to "localhost:8000" in your browser to view the website. 

## Using the program

Program intructions are given to you as you use the application.
